  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Linah Jepleting</p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>The goal of the website is to increase the business's online presence and to attract more new patients 
    by showing their services and encouraging them to book appointments. 
  </p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>The website's success will be measured by the number of appointments booked through the website.
    This includes the phone calls made through the contact us page or the emails sent via the email link.
    If the number of patients increases after the website is launched then it is safe to say that the website is successful.
  </p>
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>The target audience for this website is children,teenagers,adults and retirees from the local community who need friendly, reliable and professional dental care services.<br>
  The site will use soft professional colours like light blue, navy blue and white to create a sense of trust and hygiene which is crucial for a dental clinic.<br>
  Readability will be improved by pairing a sans-serif font for body text with a serif font for heading to help important information stand out while keeping paragraphs easy to read.<br>
  Clear, everyday language will be used instead of technical dental terms so that all users can understand the content easily.<br>
  I will design the website to have a responsive layout so that users on mobile phones and tablets can browse and find information easily. </p>
